# jockeytest
This is a test repository to delineate our translation workflow for Shopify stores.

### Notes:
I've included the entire theme in this repository however the pertinent json file is in the `/locales` directory. Currently in that folder is the English file: `en.default.json`.

This file includes translations for the theme files only. From my understanding, the products are going to be translated separately.

To set up a collaborative workflow, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine. Once you've made changes, submit a pull request and then I can pull the updated json files in to the master branch.
